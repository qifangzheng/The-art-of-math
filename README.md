# The-art-of-math
This is a computer game to be written in Pygame, aiming to practice math multiplication.
It is based on the idea of a popular computer game, space invader. After practising, we hope kids will improve the math skills in a more fun and entertain way. 

Inspired by Star War, the space invader will become a rescure mission by M Falcon. The player will be a Jedi who needs to hit the correct target missile, represented by the correct multiplication.
